Impressive-Twitter
==================

impressive-twitter is a variant of the impressive presentation software
to display tweets in real-time above the presentation.

It's pretty barebones at the moment and has some issues.

To change the twitter search query, modify "TwitterQuery" in impressive.py

You cannot change the twitter results display location at the moment.

Also, you must specify "--twitter-query=blah" (or something else for blah) on the command
line to enable the twitter display.

I'll be working on these kinks.  The current version is the version I used
to present at the SIAM Annual Meeting in 2010.
